* prog89
 A FT232x programmer for the atmel AT89S and LP series of microcontrollers. 
 NOTE: This programmer requires your FTDI module to support MPSSE. It will
 not work with older or "low end" ftdi modules. Modules known to work:
 
 * FT232H
 * FT2232
 * FT4232

** Usage:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
prog89 -[eDUk] opts

	-e			 Run chip erase before programming
	-D			 Disable auto-erase when writing
	-d devicename            Select device
	-U memory:op:file:type
				 memory: flash|fuse|lock|signature
				 op: 
					 r: read
					 w: write
					 v: verify
				 file: filename or (when in immediate mode) raw data
				 mode: 
					 i: iHex
					 r: raw binary
					 m: immediate mode
					 h: hex (output only)
				 
				 Performs <op> on <memory> type using <file>\'s 
				 data in <mode> mode
				 
				 Example:
				 ./prog89 -U flash:w:code.hex:i 
					 # Writes the data in iHex file "code.hex" to flash
				 ./prog89 -U flash:r:out.bin:r
					 # Reads data from flash into binary file "out.bin"
				 ./prog89 -U fuses:w:ff00ff00ffff0000:m
				         # Writes '0xff00ff00ffff0000' to the fuses
#+END_SRC
** Device Support
 - AT89LP213/4 
 - AT89LP52 (Coming soon!)

** Dependencies: 
 - libftdi
 - libmpsse (included)
 
** Building:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
make
make install
#+END_SRC

** Wiring:
Connect your FTDI dongle's pins to the ISP pins on the AT89. This example 
uses an AT89LP213 and an FT232H.
